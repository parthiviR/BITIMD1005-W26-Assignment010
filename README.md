## TLDR

Research a client and their users, define a clear problem statement, then use design tools like Figma (or similar design tools) to create a landing page design. You can use tools like Figma Make and other AI designing softwares, but you have to produce solid rational behind your work. Submit a short report that explains your thinking and justifies your design decisions.

---

## Description

This assignment focuses on the **thinking** behind design, not just the final output. You will:

1. Research and define a client
2. Identify who the users are and what problems they face
3. Create a clear problem statement
4. Use tools like Figma, Framer, Relume, etc. to design a landing page. 
5. Explain how your design addresses the user's needs
6. Conduct lightweight user testing with classmates or friends

**The mockup is the output, but the thinking is the grade.**

## Working with AI Tools.

In 2026, AI-assisted design tools are industry standard. Learning to use them effectively is a valuable skill. However, AI tools are only as good as the input you give them. A vague prompt produces a generic design. A well-researched prompt produces something meaningful.

This assignment teaches you to:
- Use AI tools responsibly and transparently
- Provide clear, research-backed input to AI tools
- Critically evaluate and refine AI-generated output
- Justify design decisions with human reasoning

---

## Client Details

You are open to invent as many details as you need about your client.

**Example clients:**
- A program director at a local Food Bank needing a donation landing page
- A freelance photographer wanting a portfolio site
- A small coffee shop launching online ordering
- An indie game developer promoting their upcoming release
- A student club recruiting new members

Pick something you find interesting and you'll do better work on something you care about.

## The Problem Statement

Before you open any design tool, you must write a clear problem statement. Use this formula:

> **[User]** needs a way to **[accomplish goal]** because **[insight from research]**.

**Examples:**
- "Young professionals need a way to quickly order coffee ahead because they have limited time during their morning commute."
- "First-time donors need a way to understand where their money goes because they're hesitant to give to unfamiliar organizations."
- "Casual gamers need a way to see gameplay before purchasing because they've been burned by misleading marketing before."

Your problem statement will guide your AI prompts and design decisions.

---

## Using Figma Make

Figma Make (or similar AI tools like Relume, Framer AI, or Canva's AI features) can generate landing page designs from text prompts.

**Your prompt should include:**
- Who the client is
- Who the target user is
- What problem the page solves
- Key sections or content needed
- Tone/style preferences

**Example prompt:**
> "Create a landing page for a local food bank. The target users are young professionals aged 25-35 who want to donate but are skeptical about where their money goes. The page should build trust, show impact statistics, and make donating easy. Tone should be warm and hopeful, not guilt-tripping. Include: hero section, impact stats, how it works, testimonials, and a clear donate CTA."

You may generate multiple versions and iterate. Document your prompts and explain why you chose your final design.

---

## User Testing (Lightweight)

You don't need to test with strangers. Instead:

1. Show your design to **2-3 classmates, friends, or family members**
2. Ask them:
   - "What do you think this page is for?"
   - "What would you click first?"
   - "Is anything confusing?"
   - "Does this make you want to [take the desired action]?"
3. Document their responses
4. Note any changes you made (or would make) based on feedback

This is called **hallway testing** — quick, informal, but valuable.

## Grading Rubric

This assignment is worth 15% of your final grade and marked out of 100.

| Criteria | Marks | Rationale |
|----------|-------|----------------------------|
| **Problem Definition** | 30% | Clear problem statement using the provided formula. Demonstrates understanding of the client, their goals, and how they define success. Shows evidence of research or logical assumptions about the user's needs and pain points. |
| **User Research & Tasks** | 20% | Describes who the users are, what problems they face (in context of the client), and what tasks they want to accomplish on the site. Shows empathy and insight, not just surface-level assumptions. |
| **Design Output** | 25% | Landing page design (generated via Figma Make or similar) that clearly addresses the problem statement. Design feels cohesive, intentional, and user-focused. Visual hierarchy guides the user toward the desired action. |
| **Design Justification** | 15% | Clear explanation of why design decisions were made. Connects design choices back to user research and problem statement. Documents AI prompts used and explains iteration process. |
| **User Testing** | 10% | Documents testing with 2-3 people. Includes questions asked, responses received, and insights gained. Notes any changes made (or suggested) based on feedback. |

**Note:** A polished mockup with no justification will score lower than a rougher mockup with excellent reasoning.

## AI Usage Policy

You **may** use AI tools for:
- Generating design mockups (Figma Make, Relume, Framer AI, Canva, etc.)
- Brainstorming ideas
- Writing assistance (grammar, clarity)

You **must**:
- Document all AI tools used
- Include key prompts in your report
- Explain why you accepted, rejected, or modified AI output
- Write your problem statement, user research, and justifications yourself

You **may not**:
- Submit AI-generated text as your own analysis
- Use AI to fabricate user testing results

**The goal is to use AI as a tool, not a replacement for thinking.**

## Sample Report Structure

You may follow this structure or create your own that best conveys your work.

| Section | Description | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| **Cover Page** | Title, course, name, student number | Required |
| **Problem Statement** | Your one-sentence problem statement | Use the formula provided |

| **The Users** | Who will use this website? What are their needs, frustrations, and goals? | Show empathy and insight |
| **User Tasks** | What specific tasks are users trying to accomplish? | Be specific (e.g., "donate $25" not just "donate") |
| **Design** | Full landing page mockup | Show the thing! |
| **Design Justification** | Why did you make these design choices? How does it address user needs? | Connect back to research |
| **AI Documentation** | What tools did you use? What prompts? What did you accept/reject? | Transparency required |

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Can I use copyrighted/trademarked material?**
Yes. This is an educational exercise, not commercial work. You may include brand logos in your designs.

**Can I use Lorem Ipsum text? **
Yes, for body copy. However, use real text for headlines, CTAs, and any text where meaning matters.

**Do I need to include sketches or early drafts?**
Not required, but you may include them if they help tell the story of your process.

**What if Figma Make doesn't give me what I want?**
Iterate! Try different prompts. Document what didn't work and why. You can also manually adjust the output in Figma. The iteration process is part of the learning.

**Can I use a different AI tool?**
Yes. Figma Make is recommended, but you may use Relume, Framer AI, Canva, or similar tools. Document what you used.

**What if I don't have design experience?**
That's okay! This assignment is about thinking and justification, not pixel-perfect polish. AI tools handle the visual execution — your job is the strategy.

**Do I need to create a real Figma account?**
Yes, Figma is free for students. Figma Make features may require the free trial or educational access.
